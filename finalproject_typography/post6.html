				<h2>Josef Muller-Brockmann</h2>
				<div class="col">
					<p>Josef Müller-Brockmann was born May 9, 1914 – August 30, and was a Swiss graphic designer and teacher. He began his artistic career through studying architecture, design and history of art at both the University and Kunstgewerbeschule in Zürich. Soon after in 1936, he opened his Zurich studio specializing in graphic design, exhibition design and photography. Brockmann then went onto producing concert posters for the Tonhalle in Zurich, and during this time he also became a founding editor of New Graphic Design. Typically Brockmann is recognized for his simple designs and extremely clean use of typography, shapes and colors that have continued to inspire many graphic designers even today, and will continue to do so. Similar to many of the graphic designers within the Swiss International Style, Muller-Brockmann was inﬂuenced by the ideas of many different design and art movements, which included Contructivism, De Stijl, Supermatism and the Bauhaus. Arguably, he is one of the most well-known Swiss designers, and his name is easily bought up and recognized when talking about the period. Some of his most famous work was done for the Zurich Town Hall as poster advertisements for their own theater productions. In addition to this, he also published several books, which provide an in-depth analysis of his work practices and philosophies, which is a great source of knowledge and foundation for young aspiring graphic designers who wish to go into the challenging profession. Moreover, towards the end of his life he spent most of his time working and teaching, when he then died in Zurich in 1996.</p>
