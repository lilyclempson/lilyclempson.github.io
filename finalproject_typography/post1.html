				<h2>David Carson</h2>
				<div class="col">
					<p>David Carson was born September 8, 1955, and is an American graphic designer, art director and surfer. Carson is best known and recognized for his innovative magazine design, and use of experimental typography. He was the art director for the magazine Ray Gun, in which he employed much of the typographic and layout style for which he is known. In particular, his widely imitated aesthetic defined the so-called "grunge typography" era.</p>
					<p>Carson lead to instant success once he became the art director of Transworld Skateboarding magazine in 1984, and remained there until 1988, helping to give the magazine a distinctive look. By the end of his time at the magazine he had started to develop his signature style, using "dirty" type and non-mainstream photographic techniques.</p>
					<p>Similarly, Carson was also the art director of a spinoff magazine, Transworld Snowboarding, which began publishing in 1987.</p>
					<p>Steve and Debbee Pezman, publishers of Surfer magazine, and later the Surfers Journal, employed Carson to design Beach Culture, a quarterly publication that evolved out of a to-the-trade annual supplement. Though only six quarterly issues were produced, the tabloid-size venue edited by author Neil Fineman, allowed Carson to make his first significant impact on the world of graphic design and typography. His ideas were called innovative even by those that were not fond of his work, in which legibility often relied on readers' strict attention. For one feature on a blind surfer, Carson opened with a twopage spread covered in black, an extremely bold aesthetic move during that time. After Beach Culture, Carson re designed Surfer magazine and art directed and designed it for the next 2 years, before starting the famous Ray gun Magazine for 3 years. Carson then relocated his studio to New York City, where he still works today.</p>
