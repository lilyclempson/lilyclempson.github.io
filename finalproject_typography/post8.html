				<h2>The Importance of Typography</h2>
				<div class="col">
					<p>There are many reasons why typography is so important and valuable in our soceity and day to day life. Typography attracts and holds the audience’s attention. When used correctly typography can often evoke a particular mood or feeling, due to the viewers needing to understand the important message you are trying to convey, having the right font and structural layout for that font, sets the tone for your piece or presentation before you have even begun. Similarly, using fonts that are both clean and easy to read are key to helping the viewers undertand and draw in initial attraction to your piece. In one study, researchers found that when good typography is used, people frown less and perform creative, cognitive tasks better afterwards. This therefore conveys the point to many graphic designers and creative designers in general, the true value of good typography in graphic design.</p>
					<p>In addition, typography in graphic design can strongly affect how people react to a document. Good, careful selection and consistent use of a chosen typeface can be just as important as the use of graphics, color and images in creating and solidifying a professional brand. However, in order for typography to be used successfully in design, you must anticipate how the use of different fonts and styling will inﬂuence your audience, as well as affecting the readers emotions towards the piece.</p>
