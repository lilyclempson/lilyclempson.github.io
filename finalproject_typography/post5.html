				<h2>Wim Crouwel</h2>
				<div class="col">
					<p>Wim Crouwel was born 21 November 1928, and is a Dutch graphic designer, type designer, and typographer. Between 1947 and 1949, he studied Fine Arts at Academie Minerva in Groningen, the Netherlands. In addition, he studied typography at what is now the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. In 1963, he was one of the founders of the design studio Total Design. From 1964 onwards, Crouwel was responsible for the design of the posters, catalogues and exhibitions of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. In 1967 he designed the successful typeface New Alphabet, a design that embraces the limitations of the cathode ray tube technology used by early data display screens and phototypesetting equipment, and therefore only containing horizontal and vertical strokes. Crouwel also designed other typefaces, such as Fodor and Gridnik. Additionally, In 1970 he designed the Dutch pavilion for Expo ’70.</p>
					<p>Crouwel is known today as a remarkable and inspiring ﬁgure with a hugely innovative spirit and vision, always clearly displayed and distinguished. As a designer Crouwel related to many of the Bauhaus ideas, as well as the Swiss international style. He was extremely interested by the different rational aspects in the Bauhaus typography, which he was able to discover more in depthly through the works of both Karl Gerstner and Gerard Ifert. Similarly, it has been said that Crouwel’s work has always consisted of two key elements; the emotional aspect and the rational one. Unlike many of his time, Crouwel was fascinated by the ideas about serial and mass production, as he believed we need machines to help with valuable time of production, a statement that not many other designers, at the time, believed in until then. As a result of this, Crouwel was admired for his systematic approach and his creative handling of systematic approaches.</p>
