	      <h4>The tree has entered my hands,</h4>
	      
	      <br/>

	      <p>The sap has ascended my arms,</p>

	      <br/>

	      <h4>The tree has grown in my breast</h4>

	      <br/>

	      <p>Downward,</p>

	      <br/>

	      <h4>The branches grow out of me, like arms.</h4>

	      <br/>

	      <p>Tree you are,</p> 

	      <br/>

	      <h4>Moss you are,</h4>

	      <br/>

	      <p>You are violets with wind above them.</p>

	      <br/>

	      <h4>A child so high you are</h4>

	      <br/>

	      <p>And all this is folly to the world</p>
