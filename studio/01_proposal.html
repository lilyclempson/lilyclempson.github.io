<h1>Proposal on Interactive Design</h1>

<br>

<p>Interactive design is often defined as the practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, 
systems and services. In my initial research I have been aiming to find objects and works of art that do not stand by the 
traditional and digital meaning of interactive design, but instead re-act with both the materials they are made of, and the user.
I further have looked into many examples of designers using interactive design (found on pinterest) there work and designs 
interact with the user and the material that they have been designed on. In other images that i have looked at, designers 
have worked with a more digital and computerized approach within interactive design. The designs are simple yet effective, 
and again, are reliant on the userâ€™s interaction with the product.</p>
