<h2>Initial Proposal</h2>

<br>

<p>My first chosen word was ‘interactive’ whereby I further looked into different categories that could be based within that category – primarily within design. This mainly consisted of different forms of interactive designs, within media, technology and the human form. In progression of this, I would like to look into ‘typography’ -being all the ways that we are reliant on it in our daily lives, and how different designers have incorporated it into their work through different sources of media.
This would also include looking at the work of famous typographers, such as ‘David Carson’ – as well as how it has become such a huge success in the work of graphic designers/illustrators and editorial magazines. My research could then extend back to when typography first began, and how it grew to become such a success, as well as recognized in the art world. I would source all of the images and works of art through archives as well as magazines, and different artists portfolios.  Overall, I would like to gather a large variety of artist’s work, that each differ from one another yet display the same link of showing how typography is the main and most important subject.</p>

<p>Typography is described as the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible and appealing when displayed. Typically the arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line and letter spacing, as well as adjusting the space between pairs of letters, (known as kerning). To many people, typography is the work of typesetters, typographers, graphic designers, art directors, and now anyone who arranges words or symbols meant for publication. 
“Typography is now something that everyone uses”
In addition to this, without typography key elements in day-to-day life, such as signs used for road/travel/communication, would not exist. 
A well-known typography artist is David Carson. Although Carson is an American graphic designer and art director, he is best known for his use of experimental typographic work, usually seen in magazine publishing’s. Carson’s unusual aesthetic defined the ‘grunge typography’ era.</p>
